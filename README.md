## Details
TNMplot is a tool for the comparison of normal, tumor and metastatic gene expression data. It aims to provide an easy to use tool for everyone.

We aimed to enhance the TNMplot tool by expanding the database to include stage-specific analysis, correlation analysis, and the ability to analyse multiple genes simultaneously. By incorporating these features, we aimed to provide users with a more comprehensive platform for transcriptome-based data analysis, facilitating deeper insights into tumour progression and enabling a nuanced exploration of gene expression patterns across various cancer stages and types.

The webtool is available at: https://www.tnmplot.com/

In this repository you can find the codes for the analysis done in the application. All the used data are downloaded from publicly available data repositories.
