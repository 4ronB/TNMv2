TNMplotV2
TNMplot.com, a web-based platform integrating RNA-Seq and gene-chip data from 56,938 samples, facilitates differential gene expression analysis across normal, primary tumor, and metastatic tissues, enabling comprehensive analysis of gene expression changes across 22 tumor types with publication-ready visualizations. 
Here we present an updated version of the database behind TNMplot. The new tool provides a unique feature for identifying progression-related genes through stage-based expression comparison. This analysis includes data from 4,521 patient samples, encompassing breast (n = 2,331), colorectal (n = 648), skin (n = 82), prostate (n = 61), and lung (n = 1,399) cancer cases.
In addition, new and extended visualization tools embrace a pan-cancer dot matrix for simultaneous visualization of multiple tissue types and genes. We also implemented several multi-gene analysis tools, including density plot, gene vs gene correlation, correlation matrix, correlation profile analysis, gene signature analysis, and targetgram analysis. A unique competence of TNMplot is the ability to analyze gene expression using RNA-seq and gene chip data individually, enabling independent validation across diverse patient populations. 
In conclusion, the updated TNMplot platform provides a comprehensive starting point for transcriptomic analysis for oncology-related basic, pharmacological, and translational research.
